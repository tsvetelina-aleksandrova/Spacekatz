# Spacekatz

#### The ultimate game of katz against plirds!

##### Join our super space kat troopers as they lead the battle for the Earth!

*Our precious planet is under the gruesome attack of*
*vicious birds from Pluto whose monstrous plan is*
*to contaminate the universe with their foul violet bird goo.*
*We call these birds plirds.*
*They are our worst enemy yet. And they smell bad.*

***Your mission is to save the world!***
***Your prize - the endless gratitude of mankind!***
***And chocolate chip cookies with coffee served by hot babes.***

...but enough sweet talk

The player (good guy) can:
* shoot
* move around
* level up his weapon
* lower his health when he gets shot
* die
* live 3 lives
* monitor his current score
* quit and pause the game
* win the game

The bad guys will:
